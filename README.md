# Statistical Analysis and Inference on Human Learning (Blocked v/s Interleaved)

The order in which learners are exposed to various modules and its effect on mastery and long
term retention has been widely studied in education-based literature. Most of this
experimentation has been in the field of mathematics [1] [3] [6]. Our goal is to evaluate the
effectiveness of this approach in tasks such as coding. We also aim to examine whether there is a
‘best’ order within modules that can lead to the best learning outcomes and if we can find such
an order with statistical methods.


In blocked learning, which is the conventionally accepted pattern, learners are given a series of
problems which are based on the same underlying concept. An example would be learners
solving ten problems of the Pythagorean theorem, then ten problems about fractions and so on.
On the other hand, in an interleaved pattern [2], students are exposed to various problems in no
particular order of the underlying concepts. For example, a student may first solve a problem
with the Pythagorean Theorem, then one based on fractions, then one based on area and volume,
and so on.


Previous research has shown evidence that interleaved learning may show increased performance
in mathematical tasks [3]. In [4], college students were tested on finding volumes of cubic solids,
and the problems were blocked or interleaved by the type of solid. At a later time, participants
were asked to solve previously unseen problems. It was seen that scores in the interleaved group
(63%) were almost triple than the blocked group (23%). The study in [3] went a step further and
repeated the experiment but at the same time controlling for spaced repetition. The interleaved
group still showed significantly better scores as compared to the blocked group (77% vs. 38%).
A more recent work [2] shows that the effectiveness of each approach (blocked and interleaved)
will depend on what the task at hand demands. In the active learning tasks, where participants
are provided feedback after every problem, the interleaved approach was found to be more
effective. However, the passive learning tasks had better results with the blocked approach. The
difference between the approaches was more starkly seen in the passive study. In another work
[5], it was shown that humans tend to prefer blocked approaches, even though the interleaved
approach may show better results.


The interleaving approach has also been shown to be effective in the learning of representations
[7], not only tasks. In [7], the research experimented with various representations of mixed
fractions. They found that interleaving yielded better results than blocking. They used bayesian

knowledge tracing and measures like learning rate (instead of raw accuracy rates) and it was
shown that interleaving leads to better learning.
Although the benefits of interleaving have been shown, researchers [2][3] concede that these
have been validated only in the field of mathematics, and may not generalize to other domains.
We aim to extend the work and examine its applications in a non-declarative task like coding. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that will observe a blocked versus interleaved
approach for such a task.
